The script extracts highlights from the video based on the sound intensity in the video.

The idea behind this extraction script is that in sports videos the noise and volume (by audience and commentators) is high hence there is some important event happening in the video.

To run the script:

1. Place your video files for which you want to extract highlights in a folder
2. Make a folder where you want to store the highlights
3. Make an additional forlder for sounds files

Run the script after editing the file paths at the top of the scripts
